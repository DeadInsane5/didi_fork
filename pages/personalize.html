Include whole foods: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit processed foods and added sugars. Plan meals ahead to avoid unhealthy last-minute choices. Practice mindful eating — eat slowly and stop when you're full. Keep healthy snacks like nuts or yogurt easily accessible. Don’t skip meals — it often leads to overeating later. Reflect weekly on what’s working and adjust as needed.</h1>";
